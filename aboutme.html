        <article>I'm a passionate learner and I have a great dream filled with so much passions.I want to be well educated and live my own life,help my family,and create a beautiful life for myself.I'm someone with a quite strength.I don't make noise about my struggles,but I can carry them and move on.I think a lot.Sometimes too much.I care deeply about doing things right.I'm not careless with people or dreams.I'm sincere,when I decide to learn something,I actually try.When I feel Unsure,I don't hide behind ego;I ask for help and that's courage.I'm sensitive,not weak,but aware.Words affect me.Failure stays in my mind longer than success.But that sensitivity also makes me thoughtful,kind,and able to understand others quitely.I'm someone who is becoming...Not finished.Just in transition.I sometimes doubt myself,but I can still make up things.And in last I am learning.I am growing.I am enough,exactly where I am. </article>
